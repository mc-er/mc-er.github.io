        Transposable elements (TEs) can play a pivotal role as genomic architects in genome evolution. The activation and amplification of TEs are said to be stochastic events usually caused by stress. The focus of this project has been to investigate the repeat composition in an array of relatively young sibling allopolyploids (<600000 generations) and their parental species. And by extension provide an insight into the stochasticity of repeat activation by the 'genomic shock' caused by whole-genome doubling and hybridization. <br>
        We found an increase in the genome size in the allopolyploids when comparing to the additivity genome size of the parental species. However, the repeat composition could be explained by parental additivity for most elements. The main contributor to the increase in genome size was found to be a tandem repeat, originally larger in the maternal and smaller parental genome. The tandem repeat forming clusters at the chromosome ends and showed a substructure suggesting it could be derived from  Miniature Inverted-repeat Transposable Elements (MITE).

        The Harbour seal colonies in northern Europe has been hit twice (1988 and 2002) by a virus called Phocine distemper virus (PDV) causing mortality rates up to 60%. In this 10-week thesis project, the aim was to used empirical data on the accumulative number of observed dead seals per day from one colony (Koster) that was hit particularly hard in 1988. We then used a state-based model (SEIR) with varying the infection- and recovery rate to try and explain the empirical data. <br>
