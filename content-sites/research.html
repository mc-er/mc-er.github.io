      <p>My research interests lie at the crossroads of population dynamics, evolution, population genetics, genomics and ecology to better understand the mechanisms shaping the biodiversity around us. I find hybridization, whole genome duplication (WGD) and repetitive elements to be fascinating aspects of speciations and genome evolution.</p> <br>
      <p>During my PhD my work has been about genome dynamics after recurrent allopolyploidization. By using WG-seq data I investigated the landscape of transposable elements (TEs) in an array of relatively young sibling allotetraploids (<600000 generations old) in the orchid genus <em>Dactylorhiza</em>. The main objective was to address the stochasticity of TE amplification following each allopolyploidization event. Additionally, I used RNA- and small RNA-seq data, focusing only on two of the sibling allopolyploids, to address regulatory differences both on genes and on TEs.</p><br>
      <p>In my Masterâ€™s thesis I investigated the genetic load of the selfing weed <em>Capsella bursa-pastoris</em> and if range expansion could be an additional explanation, to selfing, for accumulation of deleterious alleles.<br>

      <p>For my Bachelor's thesis I did a 10-week project with the aim to use a state-based model (SEIR) with varying the infection- and recovery rate to try and explain empirical data on the cumulative number of observed dead seals per day during an epizootic outbreak. <br>
